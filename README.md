# âœ¨ Be an A11y

I chose to release this personal project as open source, because I believe that web accessibility is too important to be kept secret. I hope, as members of the web community, we can all do better, as the current state of web accessibility is far from ideal.

This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of web accessibility, its importance, and how to implement it in your projects. It is designed for developers, designers, and anyone interested in making the web a more inclusive place. It covers the official standards, best practices, and resources.

This documentation provides an interactive list of the WCAG guidelines, with categories, filters and complementary resources. It is designed to make the guidelines easier to browse and understand. It is not a replacement for the official documentation, but a nice companion.

## How I present the guidelines

The list of guidelines will follow the _Principle > Guideline > Criterion_ structure of the WCAG, and each criterion will display color-coded tags for the team involved, the difficulty to implement and the level of conformance. You will be able to filter the list with these tags. You can expand each criterion to access a detailed description, examples, and methods to implement it.

## Additional Resources

This documentation also includes additional resources such as:

- **Checklists** - A set of checklists for the design, content and code teams
- **How to test your interfaces** - A list of tools and methods to test your interfaces
- **The extra steps** - Beyond accessibility, an introduction to inclusivity
- **Useful links** - A collection of links to resources related to web accessibility

## Roadmap

- A translation of the documentation in French
- When appropriate, an update to the WCAG 3.0 guidelines (not yet released)
